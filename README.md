# Object-detection-using-OpenCV
Object Detection project using OpenCV for Retail Security. This project focuses on leveraging computer vision to detect and track people in a retail store environment. The system uses OpenCV for object detection, and once a person is detected, a tracking algorithm is employed to draw a line representing their movement within the store.
Key Features:
Person Detection: Utilize OpenCV's object detection capabilities to identify individuals within the retail space.
Motion Tracking: Implement a tracking algorithm to follow the movement of detected persons.
Line Drawing: Visualize the trajectory of each person by drawing a line that represents their path in the retail store.
Real-time Monitoring: Achieve real-time monitoring of customer movement for security and analytics purposes.
Configurable Parameters: Easily configure parameters such as detection thresholds and tracking settings to adapt the system to different environments.
