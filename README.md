# Object-detection-using-OpenCV
Object Detection project using OpenCV for Retail Security. This project focuses on leveraging computer vision to detect and track people in a retail store environment. The system uses OpenCV for object detection, and once a person is detected, a tracking algorithm is employed to draw a line representing their movement within the store.
